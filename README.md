# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning classification model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict heart disease risk from patient health data. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze feature distributions, correlations, and outliers. Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler to optimize distance-based learning for KNN. Split data into training and testing sets using train-test split with stratification to maintain class balance. Trained and tuned the KNN model by selecting optimal k-neighbors and evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualized model performance with confusion matrix heatmaps for interpretability. Implemented probability predictions using predict_proba() for risk assessment. Deployed the trained model using Streamlit to create an interactive prediction application.
